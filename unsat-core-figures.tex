Min (minimized asserts) queries were created from original queries that returned an \unsat core, which is only possible if the original query returns \unsat. Note that projects from the same language had similar proportions of original query \unsat and min query \unsat.

      \caption{\textbf{Size ratio after keeping only the \unsat core.} File size ratios were calculated for pairs of original and corresponding minimized asserts queries where the original query returned an \unsat core and plotted on a CDF. It appears that the queries of Dafny projects and \fsdice tend to contain many asserts that are unessential to the `\unsat' result. On the other hand, \fsvwasm and \skomodo's queries tend to contain a higher proportion of asserts important to the `\unsat' result.}

      \caption{\textbf{Runtime comparison between original and minimized asserts queries.} Runtime ratios were calculated for pairs of original and corresponding minimized asserts queries where both queries returned ‘\unsat.’ The general shape suggests that queries that consist of only asserts that make up the \unsat core typically run faster than those that do not. Notably, the most minimized queries of Dafny projects and \fsdice experienced a substantial speed up, while \fsvwasm and \skomodo minimized queries did not experience as much of a change in runtime. Unexpectedly, \dlvbkv and \dfvbkv had outliers where the minimized asserts queries took much longer (35x, 70x) than the original queries.}

We observe similarities between this figure and the file size reduction figure where Dafny projects + \fsdice saw a relative decrease in their statistics, while \fsvwasm and \skomodo did not, as well as similarities between the graphs' shapes. From this figure, it is clearer that a larger proportion of \fsvwasm and \skomodo's minimized queries take longer than the original queries.}

Most queries fall close to this lower bound (3-4 seconds within) but there is a substantial number of outliers.}
